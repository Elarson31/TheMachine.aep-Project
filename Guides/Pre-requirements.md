# Guide: Pre-requirements

## I] Intro

  **First, I'm not responsible for any software cracking, license theft and using videos, pictures, documents, text files or any files without creatorâ€™s permissions.**
  
  Then, you should know that it is better to have a minimum of experience on the software used. Tutorials are available on the internet. I will consider, in the next guides, that the basics of each software are acquired.
  **These guides are not for beginners.** (but beginners can try too)
  
  If you download the project, it is either to use it in your projects, where you are under the obligation to credit TheMachine.aep. Either to contribute to TheMachine.aep to improve it in terms of resources and make it evolve positively.

## II] Softwares

  **The most important software is of course Adobe After Effects**, preferably CC 2019 version.
  As I said, to be able to use or contribute to the project, you must be familiar with the basics of this software.
  
  Then, **Adobe Illustrator** is also used. However, it is not the main software and is used occasionally. Once again, the CC 2020 version is preferable.
  
  The **Audacity software (free)** is used for the sound design of windows, but alternative software is possible.
  
  Finally, **Photoshop** is currently only used for images posted on the Trello board.
  
  **Github** is not really a software but it is also necessary to know how to use it to contribute to the project.

## III] Files

  The only files you need to download to access the project are from [this Github repository](https://github.com/Elarson31/TheMachine.aep-Project). Files external to the project may be required but are not essential for the.aep file to work as expected.
  
   Then, if you want to reproduce windows exactly like in the show, you will need the HD video of the window from the show (if you want your window added in the project, it has to be EXACTLY the same, like in the show. I cannot share files of the show to help you to reproduce because of DMCA)

## IV] Fonts

  **The required fonts are**:
  - Apple ][
  - Futura BK BT
  - Futura Std Book
  - Futura Std Light
  - Futura Std Medium
  - Futura Std Bold
  - FuturaExtended
  
  Without these fonts, the project cannot be used efficiently.
  
 

## V] Plug-ins / Presets

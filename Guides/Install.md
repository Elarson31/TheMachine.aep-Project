# Guide: Installation

Now you have everything required for the project ([PRE-REQUIREMENTS](https://github.com/Elarson31/TheMachine.aep-Project/blob/master/Guides/Pre-requirements.md)), and you have downloaded the files from this Github repository, you need to know how to install the project properly, to avoid issues.

## I] Before running the .aep file

Before running the .aep file you must install all the necessary software, fonts, plug-ins and presets on your computer.

You must also decompress the .aep files available in \TheMachine.Aep Project\Projects\After Effects\. 
The password to unzip these files is:

## II] Run the Aep file

The project is divided into 2 files:
- **The first is "The Machine UI"**: the less-developed file that will include all the recurring interfaces of The Machine
- **The second is "The Machine Windows"**: the most developed file at the moment, which includes a number of windows and will include all the windows of The Machine.


## III] Missing footage

When you run one of the files, a window may appear saying that there are **"Missing files"**. This issue is **a common one, and must be fixed to use the project.**
If you see this window, accept it. Once you have access to the entire After Effects interface you can fix the issue.

First, in the "Project" tab, click on the zoom lens with the arrow pointing down

Then click on "Missing files" and a list of all missing files will be displayed.
Double-click on the missing one and find it in the files in the TheMachine.Aep Project folder

**In reality, no files are missing in the project, you just have to search in the project folders**

## IV] Missing fonts

For missing fonts, just close Adobe After Effects, install the correct fonts on the window that appears when you launch the .aep file.

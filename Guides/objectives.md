# Guide : Objectives

In this guide, you will be able to read about the objectives of the project with the support of the community to complete it.

## I] Windows

The first objective is to make all the windows of The Machine UI.
To do so, you will need to go on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/1LnbddWi/the-machineaep-project).
On the Trello you can see which windows have already been made and which have to be.

There is 2 main status :
- Not Started : this status means that the window isn't in the Project and need to be made
- Done : this status means that the window is already in the Project

You can help to achieve this objective by contributing to the project using Github, go read [Contribute guide]()
Then, you need to know if you want your window added to the project, it has to be EXACTLY like in the show with all animations etc...

If you want the secret to make windows like in the show :
- Take the extract of the window from the show
- Trace it in After Effects
- Animate it
- It's done

(If you are a beginner on After Effects, go read tutorials how to make windows)


## II] UI

The second major objective is to make the UI itself (go on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/1LnbddWi/the-machineaep-project) if you want screenshots from the show) :
- The Feed Space : partially done
- Data Explorer : Not started, need some 3D knowledge
- The Map : Needs 3D knowledge
- Predicting Engine : More 3D knowledge
- Timeline Explorer : Partially done but need to be optimised

To be honest, I'm not a 3D guy, so I don't have any advice to tell you how to achieve this objective. If you have knowledge in 3D on After Effetcs or Cinema 4D, share it on this github to others

## III] Optimise / Correction

The Project needs to be optimised, needs some color corrections etc... 

It's just details, but it's important to do it...

## IV] Share

The final objective is to share all of my work, your work on this Github, to everyone, build a community and create content with our work.
